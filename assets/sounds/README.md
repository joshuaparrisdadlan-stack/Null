This folder is intended for sound assets. The Null world is intentionally sound-sensitive — if you add audio:
⦁	Keep sounds optional and muted by default.
⦁	Provide "tactile" cues (vibration-friendly patterns) and very short, subtle audio bursts.
⦁	Example filenames:
⦁	ping-soft.mp3 (short, low-volume pulse)
⦁	rope-tug.wav (short tactile tug)
⦁	leviathan-hum.mp3 (long, very low-frequency alert — use sparingly)
⦁	Use the Web Audio API for more control (gain nodes, filters).
⦁	Do not include loud or continuous sounds by default.
